# Simple Shell Project

A simple UNIX command interpreter written as part of the low-level programming and algorithm track at ALX.

## Description

The objective of this project is to create from scratch a simple UNIX command interpreter with limited functionality but applying the core concepts of a more robust shell. In simple words, the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. It incorporates many features and generally executes other commands.

*How does a shell work.
*What is a PID and a ppid, and how to use them.
*How to manipulate the environment of the current process.
*What is the difference between a function and a system call.
*How to create processes.
*How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs.
*How to execute another program with the execve system call.
*How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
